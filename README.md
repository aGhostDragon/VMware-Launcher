This will be a Launcher for VMware Workstation VMs in a Folder Structure, simmilar to this:

Main-folder/
			VMname1/VMname1.vmx
			VMname2/VMname2.vmx
			...

I'm doing this becouse thats the folder structure of my IT-School portable-disks and I hate the (java written)Launcher provided by the school.
